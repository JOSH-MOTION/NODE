//middleware 

Middleware is basically a function that sits between the request and the response.
It looks at the incoming request, can do something with it (like logging, authentication, parsing data), and then either:

Ends the request by sending a response, OR

Passes control to the next middleware/route handler by calling next().



const PORT = 3000;
const express = require("express");
const Path = require('path')

const server = express("server")

const middleware = (req,res,next)=>{
 
 console.log("middleware working ")
    next()
}

//routes
server.use(middleware)
server.get('/', (req,res)=>res.send('its working'))




server.listen(PORT,()=> console.log("server is working perfectly"))
